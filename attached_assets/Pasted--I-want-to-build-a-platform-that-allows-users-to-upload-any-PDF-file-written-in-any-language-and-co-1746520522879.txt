"I want to build a platform that allows users to upload any PDF file written in any language, and converts its content into a new PDF or plain text document in a language of the user’s choice. Here's what the platform should do:**

PDF Upload:

Allow users to upload one or more PDF files (scanned or digitally created).

Accept PDFs in any language or script.

Text Extraction:

Detect whether the PDF contains selectable (digital) text or scanned images.

Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for scanned PDFs.

Ensure high accuracy in extracting text, preserving basic formatting (headings, paragraphs).

Language Detection:

Automatically detect the original language of the PDF content.

Allow the user to confirm or override the detected language.

Target Language Selection:

Present a dropdown or input field for the user to select the output language.

Support a wide range of languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Arabic, Mandarin, etc.).

Translation Engine:

Use a reliable translation model (such as Google Translate API, DeepL API, or OpenAI’s language models) to translate the extracted text into the selected language.

Preserve the structure of the original content as much as possible (paragraph breaks, headings).

Output Options:

Let the user choose the output format:

Plain text (.txt)

Translated PDF (recreated with translated text)

Optionally allow the user to download both the original and translated versions side by side (dual-language PDF format).

User Interface:

Clean and simple UI with:

Upload area

Detected language display

Target language selector

Output format selection

"Translate & Download" button

Optional Features (for future improvements):

Support for batch translation of multiple PDFs.

Store translation history per user (with login).

Allow simple editing of the extracted text before translation.

Add support for text summarization or keyword extraction in the selected language.

The platform should focus on accuracy, speed, and ease of use. The translation should be context-aware and suitable for professional or academic use."
